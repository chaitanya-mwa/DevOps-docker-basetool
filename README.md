# HashiCorp Base Tool

**NOTE:** The official HashiCorp images ended up using Alpine as a base, so this is not currently in use. Alpine is easy enough to configure to fetch and verify releases without using any checked-in binaries. See the [Consul Dockerfile](https://github.com/hashicorp/docker-consul/blob/master/0.X/Dockerfile) for an example.

This tool is intended to be built, signed, and checked in to the various
HashiCorp official Docker image repositories. It's used to bootstrap the
base images by providing useful functions that would otherwise be hard to
perform given the pure Dockerfile nature of official builds, and the limited
set of tools available in BusyBox or a Scratch container.

Currently, this only knows how to fetch and verify HashiCorp releases, which
require SSL which isn't supported by the `wget` included with BusyBox. It's
written as a standard CLI app, though, so we may add more commands later.

We've also included a set of root certs required to fetch a release and contact
other APIs on hashicorp.com, such as Checkpoint. These should also be extracted
into your image and stored at `/system/etc/security/cacerts` so that the Go TLS
library will pick them up automatically.

# Building

Docker is required for building since the Go compiling happens in a container.

`./build.sh`

You can upload this release using `hc-releases upload pkg/`
